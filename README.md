# Credit-Analysis


## **Overview**
Led a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Mining project of a loan application dataset obtained from top banks, identifying more than 10 features directly impacting loan approval through insightful Data Visualization. Conducted Data Cleaning, Univariate Analysis, Bivariate Analysis, and Correlations to provide four actionable recommendations to banks to improve their ability to recognize defaulters. Employed Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and other machine learning algorithms to develop a predictive model capable of forecasting the approval rate of loan applications with an accuracy of 71% within the specified deadline.

## **Results**
Identified more than 10 features that directly impact loan approval, including credit score, debt-to-income ratio, and employment history. Provided four actionable recommendations to banks to improve their ability to recognize defaulters, including implementing a more stringent credit score threshold and conducting more thorough employment and income verification. Developed a predictive model capable of forecasting the approval rate of loan applications with an accuracy of 71%.

## **Technologies Used**
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook.
